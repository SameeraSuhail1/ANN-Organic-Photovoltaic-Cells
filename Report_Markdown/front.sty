\normalsize{Even though Organic Photovoltaic Cells (OPV) have been around since 1980s, their use was limited due
to their low efficiencies. With these efficiencies now on the rise, they have become commercially relevant.
The present study is based on OPVs that have poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) as a hole extracting layer (HEL) and anionic fluorinated ionomers (PFI) as additives in
the HEL. Analytical modeling of solar cell characteristics is difficult and to some extent inaccurate as
many assumptions have to be made. We, therefore, attempt to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in the
case of OPVs with PFI in PEDOT:PSS layer to model two characteristics of OPVs: one optical and one
electrical. Use of multilayer perceptrons along with functional link neural networks allows for comparison
of both ANNs in terms of both training times and accuracies. The accuracies obtained with both MLP
and FLANN are close to each other but, as expected, FLANN trains faster.}\\
