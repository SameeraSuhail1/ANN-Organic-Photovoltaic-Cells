abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. The aim of this work is to present a consistent model for simulation of organic solar cells (OPV) with a correct description of mobility, density of state, organic-metal contacts, and exciton. We simulate the photoconversion by means of an integration of the optical and electrical part: light absorption is calculated with a Transfer Matrix Model and the charge transport is computed using Drift Diffusion approach including the effect of energetically disorder materials. Most model parameters are directly taken from experiment. The model is used to study the effect of energetic disordered materials and cell thickness on the performance of the cell in terms of short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor. Based on the results of this model, it will be possible to design and predict the optimal thickness of OPV toward higher efficiencies.},

abstract = {The morphology of polymer composite films of poly[2-methoxy,5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and buckminsterfullerene (C60) has been systematically studied over a wide range of concentrations (10–81 wt.{\%} of C60) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Phase separation in films prepared from solutions in 1,2-dichlorobenzene results in nano-scale crystallites of C60 (dimensions approximately 10 nm or even less), embedded in amorphous MEH-PPV. A very fine bicontinuous network structure forms for MEH-PPV:C60 compositions near 1:1 by weight. This homogeneous nanostructured network morphology in the polymer composites confirms the formation of a bulk heterojunction material as inferred from the improved optical and electronic properties of these composites in device applications.},

@article{Hoppe2004,
abstract = {Organic solar cell research has developed during the past 30 years, but especially in the last decade it has attracted scientific and economic interest triggered by a rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies. This was achieved by the introduction of new materials, improved materials engineering, and more sophisticated device structures. Today, solar power conversion efficiencies in excess of 3{\%} have been accomplished with several device concepts. Though efficiencies of these thin-film organicdevices have not yet reached those of their inorganic counterparts ($\eta$ ≈ 10–20{\%}); the perspective of cheap production (employing, e.g., roll-to-roll processes) drives the development of organic photovoltaic devices further in a dynamic way. The two competitive production techniques used today are either wet solution processing or dry thermal evaporation of the organic constituents. The field of organic solar cells profited well from the development of light-emitting diodes based on similar technologies, which have entered the market recently. We review here the current status of the field of organic solar cells and discuss different production technologies as well as study the important parameters to improve their performance.},

We demonstrate generality by employing different material sets and also describe how the ink systems must be carefully co-developed in order to reach the ambitious objective of a fully printed and coated 14-layer flexible tandem solar cell stack. The roll-to-roll methodologies involved are flexographic printing, rotary screen printing, slot-die coating, X-ray scattering, electrical testing and UV-lamination. Their combination enables the manufacture of completely functional devices in exceptionally high yields. Critical to the ink and process development is a carefully chosen technology transfer to industry method where first a roll coater is employed enabling contactless stack build up, followed by a small roll-to-roll coater fitted to an X-ray machine enabling in situ studies of wet ink deposition and drying mechanisms, ultimately elucidating how a robust inline processed recombination layer is key to a high technical yield. Finally, the transfer to full roll-to-roll processing is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Polymer solar cells have drawn much attention during the past few decades due to their low manufacturing cost and incompatibility for flexible substrates. In solution-processed organic solar cells, the optimal thickness, annealing temperature, and morphology are key components to achieving high efficiency. In this work, response surface methodology (RSM) is used to find optimal fabrication conditions for polymer solar cells. In order to optimize cell efficiency, the central composite design (CCD) with three independent variables polymer concentration, polymer-fullerene ratio, and active layer spinning speed was used. Optimal device performance was achieved using 10.25mg/ml polymer concentration, 0.42 polymer-fullerene ratio, and 1624rpm of active layer spinning speed. The predicted response (the efficiency) at the optimum stationary point was found to be 5.23{\%} for the Poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T)/PC60BM solar cells. Moreover, 97{\%} of the variation in the device performance was explained by the best model. Finally, the experimental results are consistent with the CCD prediction, which proves that this is a promising and appropriate model for optimum device performance and fabrication conditions.},

@article{Howells2018,
abstract = {Fluorinated additives in PEDOT:PSS slow organic solar cell degradation and the underlying mechanisms and potentials are discussed. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used to build optoelectronic devices. However, as a hygroscopic water-based acidic material, it brings major concerns for stability and degradation, resulting in an intense effort to replace it in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. In this work, we focus on the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) polymeric additive to PEDOT:PSS. We demonstrate that it can reduce the relative amplitude of OPV device burn-in, and find two distinct regimes of influence. At low concentrations there is a subtle effect on wetting and work function, for instance, with a detrimental impact on the device characteristics, and above a threshold it changes the electronic and device properties. The abrupt threshold in the conducting polymer occurs for PFI concentrations greater than or equal to the PSS concentration and was revealed by monitoring variations in transmission, topography, work-function, wettability and OPV device characteristics. Below this PFI concentration threshold, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) are impaired largely by low fill-factors due to poor charge extraction. Above the PFI concentration threshold, we recover the PCE before it is improved beyond the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer based OPV devices. Supplementary to the performance enhancement, PFI improves OPV device stability and lifetime. Our degradation study leads to the conclusion that PFI prevents water from diffusing to and from the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer, which slows down the deterioration of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the aluminum electrode. These findings reveal mechanisms and opportunities that should be taken into consideration when developing components to inhibit OPV degradation. },

abstract = {The carrier collection efficiency ($\eta$c) and energy conversion efficiency ($\eta$e) of polymer photovoltaic cells were improved by blending of the semiconducting polymer with C60 or its functionalized derivatives. Composite films of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) and fullerenes exhibit $\eta$c of about 29 percent of electrons per photon and $\eta$e of about 2.9 percent, efficiencies that are better by more than two orders of magnitude than those that have been achieved with devices made with pure MEH-PPV. The efficient charge separation results from photoinduced electron transfer from the MEH-PPV (as donor) to C60 (as acceptor); the high collection efficiency results from a bicontinuous network of internal donor-acceptor heterojunctions.},

abstract = {Organic PV cells have gained tremendous attention in recent years for its advantage of having tailored molecular properties and economic manufacturing process. Along with the rigorous and rapid researchesprogressing in the field of organic photovoltaic cells, accurate modelling of organic PV cells has gained extreme importance. Hence in this paper, modelling of organic solar photovoltaic cells based on an improved reverse double diode model is presented. Apart from all other complex mathematical models available in literature, the modelling is performed by introducing simple circuit equations. Furthermore, the model is highly capable of realizing the ideal and non-ideal current-voltage characteristics of an organic PV cell. The eight unknown parameters of the model are extracted using Genetic Algorithm(GA) and the extracted parameters are used to predict the I-V characteristics of a nav-100 organic solar cell. The main aim of this paper is to study the behaviour of organic solar cells and to realize an accurate PV model to replicate the exact I-V characteristics.},

A distinction is made between the film-forming techniques that are used currently such as spincoating, doctor blading and casting and the, from a processing point of view, more desirable film-forming techniques such as slot-die coating, gravure coating, knife-over-edge coating, off-set coating, spray coating and printing techniques such as ink jet printing, pad printing and screen printing. The former are used almost exclusively and are not suited for high-volume production whereas the latter are highly suited, but little explored in the context of polymer solar cells. A further distinction is made between printing and coating when a film is formed. The entire process leading to polymer solar cells is broken down into the individual steps and the available techniques and materials for each step are described with focus on the particular advantages and disadvantages associated with each case.},

abstract = {The technological attraction in organic solar cells is their compatibility to printing processes. However, up to today, nearly no literature on "printed" organic solar cells have been published and the major body of the research work was done by spin coating or blading techniques. Transferring the spin-coating or doctor blading process currently used for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction solar cell to a printing process holds morphological challenges that have not been observed or reported up to today. We highlight these challenges and we show that inkjet printing of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells requires completely novel approaches and skill sets compared to the current state of the art. By adjusting the chemical properties of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) polymer donor and by using our recently developed inkjet solvent mixture, we have gained control over the nanomorphology of poly(3-hexylthiophene):fullerene blends during the printing process and report a new record power conversion efficiency of 3.5{\%} for inkjet printed poly(3-hexylthiophene):fullerene based solar cells.},
